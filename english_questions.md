## Project contextualization
AbaTech: It was my first project at the company, i had to work with a 
framework that i didn't have any familiarity with and they where off the 
schedule. My first delivery was the mvp and i did it in 1 week more or 
less, they were really surprised by my quick learning ability and the 
client was really satisfied with the initial results.
During the project lifetime i was responsible for the alignments with the 
client, gathering requirements and providing reports about the sprints, 
tasks priorization and software development.
The project goal was to become a SaaS for pshycology clinics, it should 
manage patient's medical reports, clinical history, involved psychologists,
assigned treatments, room availability and time availability for 
psychologists agenda. Later on, it was decided to also include the contract
management of the clinic in the system.
After 2 years of deligent work, the system was a robust source of 
information and management of the clinic's psychology department, the 
medical reports and patient schedules were more organized and in time, they
had a serious issue with delayed medical reports, we estimated an improve 
of 20% of the productivity of the psychologits and with the contract 
management system, the clinic's accounting department which had to renovate
patients' contracts every year leading them to manually compose and send 
many contracts every year had an imrove of productiviy in the end of the 
year of estimated 50% as the proccess became fully automated.
At the time i resigned, there were other clinics seeking to implement the 
system to their clinics as well and the client was developing a mobile 
solution of the system so that psychologists could access the system 
directly from their phone leading to a better user experience.
Looking back i consider the result of the project as a success and that it 
was in the way of achieving its SaaS goal. I'm proud of the results as i 
single handled managed and delivery almost all of it, it was a great source
of learning specially in the side of project management and quality 
ensurance which lead me to have a much greater concearn about the quality 
and impact of my work.

Lince: It was one of many projects that a client had with us. I was 
responsible for it, and it was my last project at Clickativo.
The client behind this project was a company that hosted many events and 
show rooms all around Brazil in the area of furniture, appliances and 
mattresses. The goal of the project was to provide a system that the 
clients that signed contracts for events should be able to access and 
personalize some documents and some envent criterias according to the 
contract they signed. The MVP of the project was to provide a feature 
where the client could generate an online form that participants of the 
event could fill and get a qrcode which would be tracked during the 
event by the operations team to track how much people are in the event at 
any given time. The form should be dynamic and the client should be 
able to compose many forms for a given event.
To solve this problem i used MongoDB to handle the unstructured nature of 
the forms' schema.
The client could choose from a list of predefined components like selects, 
inputs, textarea and checkboxes and assign them to a form with any guiven 
value.
But what i'm most proud in this project was the quality of the work that i 
delivered, this was the first project in the company were a test driven 
approach was used and, the first project with unit and integration tests. 
It was not a requirement, i did it on my own to ensure the quality of the 
code and reduce the number of round trips between fixes and client approval
which, during my time at that company, it presented itself as a recurring 
problem with clients.
I configured the tests pipeline and used Test Driven approach during the 
development. During the delivery of the MVP all the tests were passing and 
i didn't had to make any fix in the system because of errors or missing 
details, the client were very stisfied and the code were robust and 
maintainable. The biggest achievement was to be the first to implement 
tests in the code base and to see the impact of my actions in the client 
satisfaction.

    R: I work with web development since 2021 and have almost 3 years of 
    professional experience. During my experiences i mostly worked as a 
    fullstack developer. I'm used to have direct contact with clients to 
    gather requirements and to provide reports about the sprint.
    I have experience in working with many concurrent projects and in those
    projects i mostly worked with the MERN stack. I'm always worried about 
    the quality of my work, that's why, in one of my previuos experiences i
    was the first developer to apply tests to the code base and use Test 
    Driven Development to delivery a project with a higher approval by the 
    client.
    I have experience working with multifunctional teams and environments.
    and i'm always eager to learn and experiment with new technologies, i 
    love what i do.
