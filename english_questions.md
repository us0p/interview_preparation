## Project contextualization
AbaTech: It was my first project at the company, i had to work with a 
framework that i didn't have any familiarity with and they where off the 
schedule. My first delivery was the mvp and i did it in 1 week more or 
less, they were really surprised by my quick learning ability and the 
client was really satisfied with the initial results.
During the project lifetime i was responsible for the alignments with the 
client, gathering requirements and providing reports about the sprints, 
tasks priorization and software development.
The project goal was to become a SaaS for pshycology clinics, it should 
manage patient's medical reports, clinical history, involved psychologists,
assigned treatments, room availability and time availability for 
psychologists agenda. Later on, it was decided to also include the contract
management of the clinic in the system.
After 2 years of deligent work, the system was a robust source of 
information and management of the clinic's psychology department, the 
medical reports and patient schedules were more organized and in time, they
had a serious issue with delayed medical reports, we estimated an improve 
of 20% of the productivity of the psychologits and with the contract 
management system, the clinic's accounting department which had to renovate
patients' contracts every year leading them to manually compose and send 
many contracts every year had an imrove of productiviy in the end of the 
year of estimated 50% as the proccess became fully automated.
At the time i resigned, there were other clinics seeking to implement the 
system to their clinics as well and the client was developing a mobile 
solution of the system so that psychologists could access the system 
directly from their phone leading to a better user experience.
Looking back i consider the result of the project as a success and that it 
was in the way of achieving its SaaS goal. I'm proud of the results as i 
single handled managed and delivery almost all of it, it was a great source
of learning specially in the side of project management and quality 
ensurance which lead me to have a much greater concearn about the quality 
and impact of my work.

Lince: This was one of several projects that the client had entrusted to 
us. I had the privilege of being responsible for it, and it marked my final
project at Clickativo.

The client behind this initiative was a company that organized numerous 
events and showrooms across Brazil, specializing in furniture, appliances, 
and mattresses. The MVP of the project was a system designed to enable the 
company’s clients to create online forms for event participants. These 
participants could complete the forms and receive a QR code, which the 
operations team could use to monitor attendance and track the number of 
people present at the event in real-time.

The system required the forms to be dynamic, allowing the client to compose
multiple forms for a single event. To address this requirement, I utilized 
MongoDB to handle the unstructured nature of the forms' schema. I also 
designed a collection of components, including selects, inputs, text areas,
and checkboxes, which the client could configure with various options to 
create customized forms.

What I am most proud of in this project was the high quality of work I 
delivered. It was the first project at the company to adopt a test-driven 
development (TDD) approach, as well as the first to include both unit and 
integration tests. While these were not formal requirements, I took the 
initiative to implement them to ensure the quality of the code and reduce 
the number of iterations required for fixes and client approval—a challenge
I had observed as a recurring issue during my time at the company.

The biggest challenge was to deliver all within the due date, but i mange to
set up the test pipeline and follow the TDD approach throughout the 
development process. As a result, by the time the MVP was delivered, all 
tests were passing, and no fixes were required due to errors or oversights.
The client was extremely satisfied, and the system was robust and 
maintainable.

The most significant achievement for me was introducing automated testing 
into the codebase and witnessing its positive impact on client 
satisfaction. It was deeply rewarding to see how this initiative 
contributed to the project's success and paved the way for higher-quality 
deliverables in the future.

## Relevant Career highlights
- 3 years of career (2021-2024)
- Direct contact with clients
- Concurrent project management
- Implementing tests in a testless environment

## General and Behavioral Questions
- Tell me about yourself.
    I work with web development since 2021 and have almost 3 years of 
    professional experience.

    In those experiences i mostly worked as a fullstack developer using 
    technologies of the MERN stack including others like Docker, 
    PostgreSQL, MySQL, Typescript, Next.js and some AWS services like S3 
    and SES.

    During my last experience, each developer owned a group of projects, 
    something around 3 or 4 and, the team was small thus you usually had to
    singlehadled take care of the job, which included, besides coding,
    direct contact with clients to gather requirements and to provide 
    reports about the sprint, some times as the owner of the
    project i also had make technical decisions like the right time to 
    implement a feature, how something should be implemented, and whether 
    to use a service or not. 
    This happened because the company's mission was to not only be a group 
    of developer who code, but a strategic IT partner for the client.

    It was also a requirement for me to work with many new technologies at 
    the time, wich was great as i'm always eager to learn and experiment 
    with new technologies. Right now i'm studying Clean Architecture and 
    Microservices while i learn some other tecnologies like Kafka, Nest.js 
    and AWS Lambda.
