    R: I work with web development since 2021 and have almost 3 years of 
    professional experience. During my experiences i mostly worked as a

    gather requirements and to provide reports about the sprint.
    I have experience in working with many concurrent projects and in those
    projects i mostly worked with the MERN stack. I'm always worried about
