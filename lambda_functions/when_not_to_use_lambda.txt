When not to user Lambda
- Long-running tasks: Lambda functions have a maximum execution time limit 
  of 15 minutes (configurable up to 15 minutes). If your task requires more
  time to complete, consider using a different compute service like EC2 or 
  ECS.
- High-performance computing: Lambda functions are designed for 
  event-driven, short-lived workloads. If you need high-performance 
  computing, such as scientific simulations, data processing, or machine 
  learning, consider using EC2, ECS, or specialized services like AWS Batch
  or AWS SageMaker.
- Stateful applications: Lambda functions are designed to be stateless, 
  which means they don't maintain state between invocations. If your 
  application requires a persistent state, consider using a stateful 
  service like EC2, ECS, or a database.
- Low-latency requirements: While Lambda functions can respond quickly, 
  they might not be suitable for applications that require extremely low 
  latency (e.g., real-time systems, high-frequency trading). In such 
  cases, consider using a service like EC2 or a containerized solution.
- Large file processing: Lambda functions have limits on the size of files 
  they can process (up to 250 MB). If you need to process large files, 
  consider using a service like S3, EC2, or a specialized service like AWS 
  Elemental MediaConvert.
