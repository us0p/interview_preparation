ec2 -> virtual servers

pay for what you need, pay only for what you use.

on-premise servers can't be scaled up or down as needed.
on cloud environments you can scale up or down as the stress on your servers varies.

cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet
with pay-as-you-go pricing

Deployment models for cloud computing
When selecting a cloud strategy, a company must consider factors such as:
- required cloud application components
- preferred resource management
- tools
- legacy IT infrastructure requirements.

The three cloud computing deployment models are:
- cloud-based: You can build applications on low-level infrastructure that
  requires your IT staff to manage them. Alternatively, you can build them
  using higher-level services that reduce the management, architecting, and
  scaling requirements of the core infrastructure.
- on-premises: Resources are deployged on premises by using virtualization
  and resource management tools.
- hybrid: You might want to use this approach if you have a legacy 
  application that are better maintained on premises or government 
  regulations require your business to keep certain records on premises.

## Cloud benefits
- Trade upfront expense for variable expense: upfront expenses are 
  resources that you would need to investin before using them. Variable 
  expense means you only pay for computing resources you consume.
- Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers: The aggregated 
  cloud usage from a large number of customers results in lower 
  pay-as-you-go prices.
- Stop guessing cpacity: With cloud computing, you don't have to predict 
  how much infrastructure capacity you will need before deploying an 
  application.
- Benefit from massice economies of scale: by using cloud computing, you 
  can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own.
- Increase speed and agility: cloud provides you with more time to 
  experiment and innovate. When computing in data centers, it may take 
  weeks to obtain new resources that you need. By comparison, cloud 
  computing enables you to access new resources within minutes.
- Go global in minutes: The global footpring of the AWS Cloud enables you 
  to deploy applications to customers around the world quickly, while 
  providing them with low latency.
