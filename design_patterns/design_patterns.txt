Design Patterns

Design Patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems 
in software design. They are blueprints that can be taken and customized 
to solve a particular design problem in your code
The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for 
solving a particular problem. You can follow the pattern details and 
implement a solution that suits the realities of your own program.
