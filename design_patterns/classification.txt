Classification of patterns

All patterns can be categorized by their intent, or purpose.
The three main groups of patterns are:

- Creational patterns:
  Provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility
  and reuse of existing code.
- Structural patterns:
  Explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger 
  structures, while keeping these structures flexible and 
  efficient.
- Behavioral patterns:
  Take care of effective communication and the assignment of 
  responsibilities between objects.
