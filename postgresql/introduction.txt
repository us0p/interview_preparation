PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system 
that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that 
safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.
PostgreSQL is ACID compliant and has some add-ons to extend the database
functionality such as add geospatial data.

Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) offer several benefits, 
including robust data integrity through ACID compliance, powerful querying 
capabilities with SQL, and strong support for data relationships via data 
normalization. They are highly scalable vertically and can handle complex 
transactions reliably. However, RDBMS also have limitations such as 
difficulties in horizontal scaling, which can limit performance in highly 
distributed systems. They can be less flexible with schema changes, often 
requiring significant effort to modify existing structures, and may not be 
the best fit for unstructured data or large-scale, high-velocity data 
environments typical of some NoSQL solutions.
