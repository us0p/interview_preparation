Terms:
- Load factor: amount of data per amount of storage.
- Collision: when 2 keys maps to the same cell.
- Linear probing: is a technique used to resolve collisions in hash tables.
  The hash function calculates the hash code, and the search starts from that 
  index, moving sequentially until the target key is found or an empty cell is 
  encountered. When the end of the array is reached you modulo it to look over
  every space in the table.

Hash Table (Map)

A hash table is an array with a hash function. A hash table provides constant 
time lookup, insert, deletion and update.

The hash function receives an input and produces an output which maps to an 
index in the internal array where the value is stored.

A hash function should:
1. produce the same output for a given input.
2. be fast.
3. produce a random output, meaning, the output shouldn't follow a linear basis.

An ideal hash function would always hash different inputs to different locations.

There are two traditional ways to deal with collisions:
1. open addressing.
   - we keep everything in the table;
   - linear probing is used to solve collisions in open addressing
   - with open addressing the table is always the same size.
   - but with this linear lookup your table might get a O(n) runtime if your 
     hash table produces many collisions.
   - it's good for small to medium load factors.
2. external chaining.
   - you'll always put the value in the location that was produced by the 
     hashing function.
   - for this, every array index is instead the head of a stack. Whenever you
     add a new item, you add it as the head of the stack.
   - thus, collisions will create a stack that can be looked upon in that
     location.
   - is usually faster than open addressing, as you don't have to traverte the 
     whole table every time you get a collision.
   - it uses more memory as the size of the table is not fixed anymore.
   - if your hash function produces a lot of collisions your will end up with a
     running time of O(n), as the lookup function will have to search through 
     the linked list which might have many elements.
   - it's good for hish load factors.
