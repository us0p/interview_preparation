Asymptotic Analysis:
Is a method of describing limiting behavior.

Bit O Notation:
Big O Notation describes, how well an algorithm scales with the input size.
It is used to describe the worst case scenario of an algorithm. One can 
also say that it describes the upper bound of an algorithm.
When working with Big O you need to drop all constants. Big O is used to
measure the worst case of an algorithm, constants will become irrelevant.

Big Omega Notation:
Big Í≠• Notation is used to describe the lower bound of a function. It is 
the opposite of Big O notation. While Big O is used to describe the worst 
case scenario of an algorithm, Big Í≠• is used to describe the best case 
scenario of an algorithm.
In Omega Notation you need to take constants into consideration as they will
be of much difference with small inputs.

Bit Theta Notation:
Big ùúÉ Notation is used to describe the average case of an algorithm. In
other words what is the average scenario or the average number of inputs
the algorithm would end up processing.
