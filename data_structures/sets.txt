Set
It's a data structure which stores a collection of distinct elements.
Values within sets are immutable. You add and remove new values but you 
can't change existing values within the set.

A set can be implemented in various ways, the most common are:
- Hash-Based Set: the set is represented as a hash table where each element in
  the set is stored in a bucket based on its hash code.
- Tree-Based Set: the set is represented as a binary search tree where each
  node in the tree represents an element in the set.

There are two types of set:
- Unordered sets: is implemented using a hash table where insertion is always 
  randomized, all operations in an unordered set take O(1) time on average
  depending on the hashing function.
- Ordered sets: it's generally implemented using a balanced BST and support 
  O(log n) lookups, insertion and delete operations.
