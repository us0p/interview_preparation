A stack is a single linked list which follow the rule LIFO (Last In, First 
Out).

first element in the stack, but the las added.

Methods:
- **Push[O(1)]:** Add item to the beginning of the stack.
- **Peek[O(1)]:** Display the fist item, or the next item that should be 
  removed from the stack.
- **Pop[O(1)]:** Remove the first item of the stack.
- **Size[O(1)]:** Return the number of items in current in the stack.
