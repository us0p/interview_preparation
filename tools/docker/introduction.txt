What is Docker?
Docker is a platform that simplifies the process of creating, deploying, 
and managing containers. It provides developers and administrators with a 
set of tools and APIs to manage containerized applications. With Docker, 
you can build and package application code, libraries, and dependencies 
into a container image, which can be distributed and run consistently in 
any environment that supports Docker.

What is Docker Compose?
Docker is used to create, deploy and manage containers individually, as
your application grows, you'll at some point, deploy some other services
like a cache or a queue to attend your application needs.
Docker Compose a platform used to manage many containers at once with a
single command.
With Compose you can define all of your containers and their 
configurations in a single YAML file.

Dockerfile versus Compose file
A Dockerfile provides instructions to build a container image while a 
Compose file defines your running containers. Quite often, a Compose file 
references a Dockerfile to build an image to use for a particular service.
