Database and Collections
If a database does not exist, MongoDB creates the database when you first 
store data for that database.

Documet validation
By default, a collection does not require its documents to have the same 
schema;
However, you can enforce document validation rules for a collection
during update and insert operations.

Unique identifiers
Collections are assigned an immutable UUID. The collection UUID remains 
the same across all members of a replica set and shards in a sharded 
cluster.
