MongoDB
Is a document database designed for ease of application development and
scaling.
MongoDB Atlas is the fully managed service for MongoDB deployments in the
cloud.

Document Database
A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed of
field and values pairs (BSON document).
MongoDB documents are similar to JSON objects. The values of fields may 
include other documents, arrays, and arrays of documents.
Embedded documents and arrays reduce need for expensive joins.

Collections/Views/On-Demand Materialized Views
MongoDB store documents in collections. Collections are analogous to
tables in relational databases.
It also supports:
- Read-only Views.
- On-Demand Materialized Views.

High Availability
MongoDB's replication facility, called replica set, is a group of MongoDB
servers that maintain the same data set, providing redundancy and 
increasing data availability.

Horizontal Scalability
MongoDB provides horizontal scalability as part of its core functionality.
- Sharding distributes data across a cluster of machines.
