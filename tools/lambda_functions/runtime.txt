Lambda runtime
Lambda supports multiple languages through the use of runtimes. A runtime 
provides a language-specific environment that relays invocation events, 
context information, and responses between Lambda and the function. You can
use runtimes that Lambda provides, or build your own.
For a function defined as a container image, you choose a runtime and the 
Linux distribution when you create the container image. To change the 
runtime, you create a new container image.
When you use a .zip file archive for the deployment package, you choose a 
runtime when you create the function. To change the runtime, you can update
your function's configuration. The runtime is paired with one of the Amazon
Linux distributions. The underlying execution environment provides 
additional libraries and environment variables that you can access from 
your function code.
Lambda invokes your function in an execution environment. The execution 
environment provides a secure and isolated runtime environment that manages
the resources required to run your function. Lambda re-uses the execution 
environment from a previous invocation if one is available, or it can 
create a new execution environment.
