Test Double: generic term for any case where you replace a production object
for testing purposes.

- Dummy: objects are passed around but never acctually used. Usually they are
  just used to fill parameter lists.
- Fake: objects actually have working implementations, but usually take some
  shortcut which makes them not suitable for production (an in memory datab-
  ase is a goos example).
- Stubs: it's a simulated object that provides hard-coded answers to calls 
  made during the test.
- Spies: allows you to track the calls made to its methods, including inform-
  ation such as the arguments passed, the number of times a method was calle-
  d, and the context in which it was called.
- Mocks: Mocks are similar to stubs in that they simulate the behavior of an
  object, but they also provide additional verification capabilities. With 
  mocks, you can specify expectations or assertions about how the mock obje-
  ct should be interacted with.

Decision tree between Stubs, Spies and Mocks:
- If you need to observe how a function is called (number of times, arguments
  , etc.) without modifying its behavior, use a spy.
- If you need to simulate the behavior of a dependency to isolate your test, 
  use a stub.
- If you need to simulate behavior and verify specific interactions (number 
  of calls, arguments, etc.), use a mock.
