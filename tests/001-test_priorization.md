# Test Priorization
Is the process of assigning priority levels to individual test cases based 
on their significance, and potential impact on the software application 
being tested.

The goal is to boost effectiveness guaranteing that testing activities are 
directed toward the most crucial facets of the software.

By prioritizing test cases, testers and developers are able to minimize the
time and cost of software testing phase and make sure that the delivered 
product is of exceptional quality.

## What are different Test Case Priority Levels?
- **Priority 1/Critical:** Must be executed asap. Critical test cases where
  the chances of getting a functionality disrupted is higly possible.
- **Priority 2/High:** Could be executed with enough time.
- **Priority 3/Normal:** Not important to be tested as there's no direct 
  dependency on it. These can be tested later, shortly after the release.
- **Priority 4/Low:** Failure on this test is likely to indicate a trivial 
  problem with the functionality, impact is nearly negligible.

## Different Techniques to decide Priority
- **Coverage-based priorization:** cases based on the source code or recent 
  code changes. Aims to optmize efforts by prioritizing areas of the code 
  that are more likely to contain defects.
- **Risk-based priorization:** arrange test cases according to the 
  perceived risk linked to particular functionalities or sections of the 
  software.
- **Requirements-based priorization:** criticality and significance of each 
  requirement is evaluated, and test cases related to high-priority 
  requirements are given precedence.
- **History-based priorization:** Pioritize test cases based on historical 
  data and the outcome of precvious testing cycles.
- **Cost-based priorization:** considers the economic factors associated 
  with test execution detection. Test cases are prioritized aiming to 
  achieve the maximum value with the available resources.

## Factors to consider when deciding priority of test cases
- Business impact.
- Critical functionalities.
- Risk Assessment: consider factors such as complexity, dependencies, and 
  historical defect data.
- Regulatory compliance.
- Customer impact.
- Regression testing.
- Historical data: prevent the reccurrence of known problems.

## Best practices for efficient Test Priority
- Understand the critical functionalities that directly impact business 
  goals and revenue.
- Involve stakeholders, including business analysts, product owners, and 
  end-users, in the prioritization process.
- Perform a thorough risk analysis to identify high-risk functionalities.
- Identify and prioritize industry compliance-related test cases.
- Use test management tools to optimize and efficiently handle 
  prioritization.
- Regularly review and update priorities.
- Prioritize regression test cases to avoid breaking changes.
- consider the usage frequency of a function or the probability of failure 
  in software use.
- The failure risks of the test cases should be measured.
- Quality characteristics may have different importance to the customer or 
  client.
- Areas with complex coding and with past histories of problems should be 
  taken into account.
- Prioritizing test cases implies understanding of what parts of the 
  software have to test at first.
