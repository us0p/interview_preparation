Test Driven Development
It's a practice where you first write the test and then write the code which should
passes the tests.
In TDD you achieve 100% test coverage.
You should know why you are testing something and at what level it should be tested.

TDD is divided into 4 steps:
- Write the test.
- Make the test pass.
- Refactor your code to be efficient and clean.
- Repeat.

Benefits of TDD:
- Early bug notification.
- Better designed, cleaner and more extensible code.
- Confidence to refactor.
