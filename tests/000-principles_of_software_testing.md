# Principles of software testing
1. Testing shows the presence of defects
    - the goal of software testing is to make the software fail. Software 
      testing talks about the presence of defects and doesn't talk about 
      the absence of defects.
    - Software testing can ensure that defects are present but it can not 
      prove that software is defect-free.
2. Exhaustive testing is not possible
    - It is the process of testing the functionality of the software in all
      possible inputs (valid or invalid). it means the software can never 
      test at every test case. It can test only some test cases and assume 
      that the software is correct and it will produce the correct output 
      in every test case.
3. Early testing
    - To find the defect in the software, early test activity shall be 
      started. The defect detected in the early phases of SDLC will be very
      less expensive.
4. Defect clustering
    - In a project, a small number of modules can contain most of the 
      defects. The Pareto Principle for software testing states that 80% of
      software defects come from 20% of modules.
5. Pesticide paradox
    - Repeating the same test cases, again and again, will not find new 
      bugs. So it is necessary to review the test cases and add or update 
      test cases to find new bugs.
6. Testing is Context-Dependent
    - The testing approach depends on the context of the software developed.
7. Absence of Errors fallacy
    - If a built software is 99% bug-free but does not follow the user 
      requirement then it is unusable. It is not only necessary that 
      software is 99% bug-free but it is also mandatory to fulfill all the 
      customer requirements.
