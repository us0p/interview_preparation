## Todo
- [x] Create a list of concepts to review every morning.
- [x] Create Morning routine that need to be executed every day.
- [ ] Change experiences from backend to fullstack in linkedin.
- [ ] Change linkedin cover.
- [ ] Search techniques to read and solve problems faster.

## Routine - 12h
- **1h:** Review
- **1h:** Problem Solving
- **30m:** Keyboard
- **2h:** Study, Courses, Events
- **3h:** Side projects
- **30m:** English
- **30m:** Linkedin, Job applications
- **3h:** University exams
- **30m:** Essay
- **1h:** Reading

## University study plan
The exam will have 3h of duration.
I'm estimating 30 minutes for the essay and 150 minutes for the 46 
questions.
This leaves and average of 3 minutes per question.

The study plan will follow the calendar provided by Hexag, having 24 
lessons per week, with 5 blocks per day, in which
- 4 blocks for lessons
- 1 block for exercises, 2 exercises per lesson, with 2 extra exercises for
  lessons with difficulties.

Each block of work is 30 minutes long and it's followed by a block of rest 
of 6 minutes.

## Points of attention
- What causes delays during the activities to cause them to finish after 
  the estimated time?

## Pomodoro timers
- **3h:** 45m/w + 10m/sr + 25m/lr -> 75% work rate
- **1h 30m:** 25m/w + 5m/sr + 5m/lr -> 83% work rate
- **1h:** 50m/w + 10m/lr -> 83% work rate
- **2h:** 30m/w + 5m/r + 20m/lr -> 75% work rate

## Study
Studying is divided in two parts:
- Study (gather new concepts and ideas)
- Review (revisit and further knoledge already studied)

Should take notes only about concepts, patterns and principles.
Should not take notes about the functionality or details about tools and 
technologies, the understanding of these things should be from practical 
experience, taking notes about it won't help as you won't remember all the 
details you noted about all the tools, and when you need to remember or 
learn some detail you'll probably go to the tool documentation anyway.
You should maintain a list of the most required technologies in the market 
and try to be familiar with most of them by using them in side projects and
keep up to date with them.

## Side Project Ideas
- AI Quizz: define a set of documents which you should review every day and
  make an AI assistant that will make questions based on the separated 
  documents, wich you should answer with your own words.
- Stay up to date: A software that pulls updates about specified techs from
  many sources to give you the most recent information about the tech 
  world.
- Pattern Mentor: Create a cli tool based on a AI model to perform pattern 
  implementation checks in a code base and provide meaningful insights of 
  how to improve.
- Refactor: A code repository with projects with bad designs that the user 
  can clone and refactor the application to apply some pattern or principle
  to improve the maintanability, scalability and testability of the 
  application.
  - [Projects in C# you can try to refactor to your language and apply some design patterns](https://github.com/dodyg/practical-aspnetcore)
- [Microservice project ideas](https://github.com/mjebrahimi/Awesome-Microservices-DotNet?tab=readme-ov-file#sample-projects)
- [Distributed systems ideas](https://github.com/roma-glushko/awesome-distributed-system-projects)

## English topics
- Expressions.
- Vocabulary.
- Practice to interview questions, specially what to say for the question 
  "tell me about yourself".
- Practice describing past projects, what was your role, challenges you 
  faced, how you solved them and the result of the projects.

## Linkedin
- Increase number of connections - 20x/day.
