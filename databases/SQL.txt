Relational Databases
Provides a storage for related data tables.

ACID:
- Atomicity
- Consistency
- Isolation
- Durability

New SQL databases (usually cloud based) can are capable of horizontally
scalling Relational Databases by using partitioning and sharding.
A partition is a division of a logical database or its constituent
elements into distinct independent parts.

Relational databases must have a stadardized schema for each of its tables,
which must be defined before use.
Every relational database follow the structured query language but each one
have its own implementation which leads to some differences in query structure
and behavior between RDBMS.
Relational databases are ACID complient, thus keeping tables in sync and
ensuring transactions.
In relational databases you usually don't want to have duplicated data, as
you'll be utilizing the stablished relations to join related data.
