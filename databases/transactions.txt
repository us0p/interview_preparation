Transactions
Is a sequence of multiple operations performed on a database, and all served 
as a single logical unit of work — taking place wholly or not at all. In 
other words, there’s never a case that only half of the operations are 
performed and the results saved.
If your database is running a transaction as one whole atomic unit, and the 
system fails, the transaction can be undone, reverting your database to its 
original state. Typically, a term like rollback refers to the process that 
undoes any changes made by the transaction, and the term commit is used to 
refer to a permanent change made by the transaction.

During its lifecycle, a database transaction goes through multiple states. 
These states are called transaction states and are typically one of the 
following:
- Active states: It is the first state during the execution of a 
  transaction. A transaction is active as long as its instructions (read or 
  write operations) are performed.
- Partially committed: A change has been executed in this state, but the 
  database has not yet committed the change on disk. In this state, data is 
  stored in the memory buffer, and the buffer is not yet written to disk.
- Committed: In this state, all the transaction updates are permanently 
  stored in the database. Therefore, it is not possible to rollback the 
  transaction after this point.
- Failed: If a transaction fails or has been aborted in the active state or 
  partially committed state, it enters into a failed state.
- Terminated state: This is the last and final transaction state after a 
  committed or aborted state. This marks the end of the database transaction 
  life cycle.

In relational databases, transactions must be atomic, consistent, isolated 
and durable. These properties are commonly abbreviated as ACID. ACID 
properties ensure that a database transaction is processed reliably.
