Model View Controller Architecture (MVC)
Is an architectural pattern that separates the concerns of a software 
system into three distinct components: the model, the view, and the 
controller, where the model represents the data and the business logic of 
the system, the view represents the user interface of the system and the 
controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. The main
goal of MVC is to separate the concerns of the system, making it easier to 
understand, maintain and evolve.
