Enterprise Service Bus - ESB
Is an architectural pattern that centralized software component performs 
integrations between applications.
It performs transformations of data models, handles connectivity and 
messaging, performs routing, converts communication protocols and 
potentially manages the composition of multiple requests.
The ESB can make these integrations and transformations available as a 
service interface for reuse by new applications.
