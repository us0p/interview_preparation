Service Oriented Architecture - SOA

Is an architectural pattern that is used to design and organize 
software systems as a collection of services that can be accessed 
over a network, these services are autonomous, self-contained units 
of functionality that can be reused and combined to create new 
functionality.
Services are designed to be loosely coupled, meaning that they do not 
depend on the implementation details of other services, they communicate
with each other through well-defined interfaces, usually using a protocol
such as HTTP or SOAP. 
SOA provides several advantages over other architectural patterns, such as
reusability, modularity, interoperability, and scalability.
