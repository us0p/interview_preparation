Message Queue Streams
Message queues and streams are architectural patterns that are used to 
decouple different components of a system and enable asynchronous 
communication between them.
Message Queues: A message queue is a software component that allows 
multiple systems or applications to communicate with each other by passing 
messages between them.
This pattern is useful for systems where the sender and receiver do not 
need to be active at the same time.
The basic architecture of a message queue is simple: there are client 
applications called producers that create messages and deliver them to the 
message queue. Another application, called a consumer, connects to the 
queue and gets the messages to be processed. Messages placed onto the queue
are stored until the consumer retrieves them.
Since protocol methods (messages) sent are not guaranteed to reach the peer
or be successfully processed by it, both publishers and consumers need a 
mechanism for delivery and processing confirmation. Delivery processing 
acknowledgments from consumers to Broker are known as acknowledgments; 
Broker acknowledgments to publishers are a protocol extension called 
publisher confirms.
