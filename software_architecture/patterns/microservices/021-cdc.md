# Change Data Capture (CDC)
A set of sotware design patterns used to determine and track the data that 
has changed (the "deltas") so that action can be taken using the changed 
data. The result is a **delta-driven dataset**.
It enables monitoring and tracking of modifications such as inserts, 
updates, and deletes, allowing systems to stay synchronized and updated 
with real-time changes.
It's also a method of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load).
