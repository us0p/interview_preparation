Two-Phase Commit (2PC)
Is a standardized protocol that ensures atomicity, consistency, isolation, 
and durability (ACID) of a transaction in a distributed system. It is an 
atomic commitment protocol for distributed systems, which ensures that all 
nodes participating in a transaction either commit or abort together.

The 2PC protocol functions in two phases:
- Voting phase: Each node votes on whether it can commit to the 
  transaction. If any node votes no, the transaction is aborted.
- Commit phase: If all nodes vote yes, the transaction is committed.

2PC is used to maintain consistency and coordination in distributed 
database systems, ensuring that all nodes have the same view of the data. 
It is commonly used in distributed transactions, such as online banking and
e-commerce applications.

However, 2PC has some limitations, including:
- Performance: 2PC can be slow due to the need for multiple rounds of 
  communication between nodes.
- Availability: If one node fails during the commit phase, the entire 
  transaction may be rolled back.
