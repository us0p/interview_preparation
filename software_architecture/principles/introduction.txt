Architectural principles 
Refer to a set of guidelines or rules that are used to guide the design and
development of a software architecture. These principles are intended to 
ensure that the resulting architecture is maintainable, scalable, and easy
to understand and modify. Some common architectural principles include:
- Separation of concerns: This principle asserts that software should be 
  separated based on the kinds of work it performs. For instance, consider
  an application that includes logic for identifying noteworthy items to 
  display to the user, and which formats such items in a particular way to
  make them more noticeable. The behavior responsible for choosing which 
  items to format should be kept separate from the behavior responsible for
  formatting the items, since these behaviors are separate concerns that 
  are only coincidentally related to one another.
- Modularity.
- Loose coupling.
- Hish cohesion.
