Component Principles
Component principles in software architecture refer to guidelines for 
designing and implementing software components that are modular, reusable,
and easy to understand, test, and maintain. Some of the key component 
principles in software architecture include:
- High cohesion
- Low coupling
- Separation of concerns
- Interface-based design
- Reusability
- Testability
- Modularity
- Interoperability
