Monolithic

In software architecture, monolithic architecture is a design approach in which 
a software system is built as a single, integrated, and self-contained unit. 
In a monolithic architecture, all the components of the system are tightly coupled 
and depend on each other. This means that changes in one part of the system may 
affect other parts of the system.
A monolithic architecture is often used for small to medium-sized systems, where 
the complexity of the system is manageable and the need for scalability and 
flexibility is not as high. In a monolithic architecture, the entire system is 
typically built, deployed, and executed as a single unit, which can make it easier 
to understand and manage the system.

The advantages of a monolithic architecture include: 
1. Easy deployment – One executable file or directory makes deployment 
   easier.
2. Development – When an application is built with one code base, it is 
   easier to develop.
3. Performance – In a centralized code base and repository, one API can 
   often perform the same function that numerous APIs perform with microservices.
4. Simplified testing – Since a monolithic application is a single, 
   centralized unit, end-to-end testing can be performed faster than with a distributed application. 
5. Easy debugging – With all code located in one place, it’s easier to 
   follow a request and find an issue.

Monolithic applications can be quite effective until they grow too large 
and scaling becomes a challenge.

The disadvantages of a monolith include: 
1. Slower development speed – A large, monolithic application makes 
   development more complex and slower.
2. Scalability – You can’t scale individual components.
3. Reliability – If there’s an error in any module, it could affect the 
   entire application’s availability.
4. Barrier to technology adoption – Any changes in the framework or 
   language affects the entire application, making changes often expensive
   and time-consuming.
5. Lack of flexibility – A monolith is constrained by the technologies 
   already used in the monolith.
6. Deployment – A small change to a monolithic application requires the 
   redeployment of the entire monolith.
