Publis-Subscribe

The publish-subscribe pattern is a messaging pattern in which a publisher 
sends a message to a topic, and any number of subscribers can subscribe to
that topic to receive the message. The publish-subscribe pattern is also 
known as the “observer pattern” and is a way of implementing communication
between different parts of an application in a decoupled way.
The main advantage of using the publish-subscribe pattern is that it can 
improve the flexibility and scalability of the system. Additionally, it 
allows for loose coupling between components, meaning that the publisher 
and subscribers are not aware of each other’s existence, and can be 
developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
