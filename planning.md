- [ ] Create freelancer approach.
- [ ] Update CV.
   - [x] - PT
   - [ ] - EN
- [ ] Add metrics to experiences on linkedin.

## Routine - 12h
1. **3h:** Study
2. **1h 30m:** DSA
3. **3h:** Coding
4. **3h:** Exams
5. **30m:** English
6. **1h:** Linkedin

## Points of attention
- What causes dealys during the activities to cause them to finish after 
  the estimated time?

## Pomodoro timers
- **2h:** (50m/w + 10m/r) * 2
- **3h:** 40m/w + 15m/sr + 30m/lr
- **1h 30m:** 20m/w + 5m/sr + 20m/lr

## Study
Studying is divided in two parts:
- Study (gather new concepts and ideas)
- Review (revisit and further knoledge already studied)

Should take notes only about concepts, patterns and principles.
Should not take notes about the functionality or details about tools and 
technologies, the understanding of these things should be from practical 
experience, taking notes about it won't help as you won't remember all the 
details you noted about all the tools, and when you need to remember or 
learn some detail you'll probably go to the tool documentation anyway.
You should maintain a list of the most required technologies in the market 
and try to be familiar with most of them by using them in side projects and
keep up to date with them.
  
**Concepts to study**
- Cloud computing: overall cloud understanding, and introduction to common 
  services used in microservice architecture.
- Lambda functions
- Backend: overall backend knowledge.
- Node.js runtime: understand event loop (how to use it in practice), 
  memory model, threads and streams.
- Clean Architecture
- Exagonal Architecture
- Clean Code
- Terraform
- Grafana
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- MongoDB: Experience working with distributed databases.

## Courses
- [MIT Distributed Systems](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/)
- [Papers on distributed systems](https://github.com/theanalyst/awesome-distributed-systems)
- [More about distributed systems](https://github.com/binhnguyennus/awesome-scalability)
- [Simple patterns explanations](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/design-patterns-for-humans)
  
## DSA
**Goal:** Understand basic DSA and algorithm strategies to efficiently 
solve problems.

- array
  - hash-table
    - set
- graph
  - spanning-tree
- tree
  - heap
  - binary-tree
  - trie
  - set
- linked-list
  - stack
  - queue

- mon -> array
- tue -> linked-list
- wed -> tree
- thu -> graph
- fri -> interview prep list

## Coding
Should be used to create projects which shows practical experience with 
required expertise in real jobs.

### Project Ideas
- Pattern Mentor: Create a cli tool based on a AI model to perform pattern 
  implementation checks in a code base and provide meaningful insights of 
  how to improve.
- Refactor: A code repository with projects with bad designs that the user 
  can clone and refactor the application to apply some pattern or principle
  to improve the maintanability, scalability and testability of the 
  application.
  - [Projects in C# you can try to refactor to your language and apply some design patterns](https://github.com/dodyg/practical-aspnetcore)
- [Microservice project ideas](https://github.com/mjebrahimi/Awesome-Microservices-DotNet?tab=readme-ov-file#sample-projects)
- [Distributed systems ideas](https://github.com/roma-glushko/awesome-distributed-system-projects)

## English topics
- Expressions.
- Vocabulary.
- Practice to interview questions, specially what to say for the question 
  "tell me about yourself".
- Should add a list of what to say about the projects that you've worked 
  with, the challenges that you faced, how did you solved them, the 
  results of your actions and also talk about the technical aspects.

## Linkedin
- Increase number of connections - 20x/day.
- Write posts - 1x/week.
  - Thoghts about pattern and principles.
  - DSA challenges sollutions and thoghts.
