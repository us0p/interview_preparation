## Study
Studying is divided in two parts:
- Study (gather new concepts and ideas)
- Review (revisit and further knoledge already studied)
- alterei alguma coisa
- alterei outra coisa

  
**Concepts to study**
- Cloud computing: overall cloud understanding, and introduction to common 
  services used in microservice architecture.
- Backend: overall backend knowledge.
- Node.js runtime: understand event loop, memory model, threads and 
  streams.
- Clean Architecture
- Clean Code
- Terraform
- Grafana
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- MongoDB

## DSA
**Goal:** Understand basic DSA and algorithm strategies to efficiently 
solve problems.

- array
  - hash-table
    - set
- graph
  - spanning-tree
- tree
  - heap
  - binary-tree
  - trie
  - set
- linked-list
  - stack
  - queue

- mon -> array
- tue -> linked-list
- wed -> tree
- thu -> graph
- fri -> interview prep list

## Coding
Should be used to create projects which shows practical experience with 
required expertise in real jobs, those being:
- Event-Driven architecture
- Microservices architecture
- Unit testing

### Project Ideas
- Pattern Mentor: Create a cli tool based on a AI model to perform pattern 
  implementation checks in a code base and provide meaningful insights of 
  how to improve.
- Refactor: A code repository with projects with bad designs that the user 
  can clone and refactor the application to apply some pattern or principle
  to improve the maintanability, scalability and testability of the 
  application.
