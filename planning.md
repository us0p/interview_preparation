## Routine - 8h
- **3h:** Study
- **2h:** DSA
- **3h:** Coding
- **30m:** English
- **30m:** Linkedin

## Study
Studying is divided in two parts:
- Study (gather new concepts and ideas)
- Review (revisit and further knoledge already studied)
  
**Concepts to study**
- Cloud computing: overal cloud understanding, and introduction to common 
  services used in microservice architecture.
- Node.js runtime: understand event loop, memory model, threads and 
  streams.
  
**Concepts to review**
- Unit Testing
- Patterns and Principles
  - [Simple patterns explanations](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/design-patterns-for-humans)
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Mircroservices Architecture

## DSA
**Goal:** Understand basic DSA and algorithm strategies to efficiently 
solve problems.

- array
  - hash-table
    - set
- graph
  - spanning-tree
- tree
  - heap
  - binary-tree
  - trie
  - set
- linked-list
  - stack
  - queue

- mon -> array
- tue -> linked-list
- wed -> tree
- thu -> graph
- fri -> interview prep list

## Coding
Should be used to create projects which shows practical experience with 
required expertise in real jobs, those being:
- Event-Driven architecture
- Microservices architecture
- Unit testing

### Project Ideas
- Pattern Mentor: Create a cli tool based on a AI model to perform pattern 
  implementation checks in a code base and provide meaningful insights of 
  how to improve.
- Refactor: A code repository with projects with bad designs that the user 
  can clone and refactor the application to apply some pattern or principle
  to improve the maintanability, scalability and testability of the 
  application.
  - [Projects in C# you can try to refactor to your language and apply some design patterns](https://github.com/dodyg/practical-aspnetcore)
- [Microservice project ideas](https://github.com/mjebrahimi/Awesome-Microservices-DotNet?tab=readme-ov-file#sample-projects)

## English topics
- Expressions.
- Vocabulary.
- Practice to interview questions, specially what to say for the question 
  "tell me about yourself".

## Linkedin
- Increase number of connections - 20x/day.
- Write posts - 1x/week.
  - Thoghts about pattern and principles.
  - DSA challenges sollutions and thoghts.
