should add keyworkds and skills (preferably related to the opportunity, but
it can be tailored according to what you want to do).
should also include soft skills.
adding metrics to resume about the impact of your job is also a good idea.
your resume should contain something between 475 to 600 words.
should be direct in your resume and avoid cliches, for example: 
"motivated", "passionate", "creative", "detail-oriented", "team-players", 
"synergies", etc. Your resume should be selling your experience, not 
summarizing it. You can also google it, for example: "resume cliches and 
buzzwords" and remove all that appear in your resume.
the keywords in your resume should be followed with a context, your 
shouldn't add keywords without a context.

you should not put your education section above the experience section
in your experiences you should add also the impact of those actions, you 
should not only what you've done, but also what where the results of your 
work, for example if you helped your client to achieve what he wanted or 
not.
to explain your experiences and achievements you can use the following 
formula: "achieved [x], as measured by [y], by doing [z]".
also note that you can add measurements about team productivity increase.
the metrics you add to your experience shoud be meaningfull, and, the exact
number isn't required, they're more concerned about your effort to reach 
that number (you should also not fake it!).
your resume should be tailored for each role you're applying to.
and also you resume should be perfectly formated and gramatically correct 
100%.
