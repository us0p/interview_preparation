On-Demand Materialized Views
An on-demand materialized view is a pre-computed aggregation pipeline 
result that is stored on and read from disk. On-demand materialized views 
are typically the results of a $merge or $out stage.

Note that as this view is stored on disk, to have updated values you need
to manually update its registers, for example, running the same pipeline
used to create the view.
