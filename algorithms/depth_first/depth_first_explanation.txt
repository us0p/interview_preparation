Depth First
Is a traversl strategies used in tree and graphs structures.
Its name is due the fact that strategies which implement it, go all the way
down one side of the tree, before starting to process the value of each node.
Thus when we are talking about recursion, In-order and Post-order strategies
are classified as Depth First traversals.

There are three points in which a recursive function can perform the processing
of its data:
- Pre-order: when the recursive function perform the processing before the
  recursive steps.
- In-order: when the recursive function perform the processing between the
  recursive steps.
- Post-order: when the rescursive function perform the processing after the
  recursive steps.

As you can see both, In-order and Post-order strategies perform the processing
of the data after a recursive step, this recurvise step is used to visit the
last node of a branch of the tree, which makes it a depth first strategy.

When performing a Depth First operation in a graph you'll follow the connection
of a given edge vertice until the end before following other vertices the same
edge.

Time Complexity: 
    tree: O(h)
    graph: O(v + e)
