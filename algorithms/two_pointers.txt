Two Pointers
Used to search pairs in a sorted array.
The algorithm basically uses the fact that the input array is sorted and
conditionally move both pointers.

example:
Find if there is any pair of elements such that their sum is equal to X.

int x = 17;
int arr[7] = {2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11};
for(int i = 0; j = 7 - 1; i < 7;) {
    int sum = arr[i] + arr[j];
    if (sum == x) {
	printf("elements at position %d and %d sum up to %d\n", i, j, x);
	return;
    }
    if (sum < x) i++;
    if (sum > x) j++;
}

The running time of this algorithm is O(n) as we run over each element 
once.
The common approach would be to run the whole array for each element to
check for sums, which would have a O(nÂ²) runtime.
