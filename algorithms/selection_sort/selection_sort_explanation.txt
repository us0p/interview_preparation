Selection Sort

You can think in this algorithm as the inverse of bubble sort.
Instead of putting the largest element at the end of the array, it puts the
smallest ellement at the beginning of the array at each interation.

Selection Sort Steps:
1. Loops over the array.
2. Create a min_index variable that starts at i.
3. Create a inner loop that will loop from the position i+1 until the end of
   the array.
4. If the element at position j is smaller than the element at position i, 
   update the min_index to j.
5. When the inner loop exits, you'll have fount the smallest element index,
   Now, if min_index is different than i you need to swap the element at 
   min_index index with element at i index.

Time Complexity: O(nÂ²);
