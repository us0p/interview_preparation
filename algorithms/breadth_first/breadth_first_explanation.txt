Breadth First
Breadth First, is a type of traversal, in this type of traversal you visit 
every node, left to right, within a given level of the tree before going to 
the next.
In this traversal is common to use a Queue to store the correct order to be
traversed.

When Performing a Breadth First opeartion in a graph you need to check every
vertice of a given node before going to the next edge.

Time Complexity: 
    tree: O(h)
    graph: O(v + e)
