# Binary Search
In an ordered array, we can check the middle element of the set and
check if the element is smaller, greater or equal to what we're looking
for.
If it's smaller or greater we can check the middle element of the respective
half accordingly and keep halving the search input until we get to a
single element or an empty array.

Binary Search have both recursive and iterative implementations.

Time complexity: O(log n)
