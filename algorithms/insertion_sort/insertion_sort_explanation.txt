Insertion Sort
The core idea of this algorithm is "an array of 1 element is always sorted".
It works by expanding the view of 1 element until it englobes all elements 
in the array. Every new element added to the view is swaped with its 
previous element if smaller then until the new element reaches the right 
position.

Insertion Sort Steps.
1. Create an outer loop that starts at i = 1 (the element at 0 is
   treated as sorted) and goes until the end of the array.
2. Store the value of array[i] (new element).
2. Create a inner loop which will start at j = i - 1, and will run backwards
   checking the already sorted elements.
3. If the element at array[j] is smaller than the new element, swap their
   positions, thus, array[j] should receive new element and array[j + 1]
   should receive the old element.

Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)
