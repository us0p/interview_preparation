   - 2nd week - easy
   - 3rd week - medium
   - 4th week - hard

Day of the week topic group distribution:

    - depth-first search
    - binary search
    - breadth-first search
    - shortest path
    - merge sort
    - hash function

3. Algorithm strategies:
    - two pointers
    - sliding window
    - union find
    - memoization

4. Data structures:
