Picking a language:
If you use stackoverflow survey you can track the least popular languages
with the highest paying rate in the last year, and, if the language is
consistent over the survey in the past years, you can then search in 
Linkedin for the number of available roles for that language, with that you
can apply to roles that will pay you a good sum and won't have too much 
competition.
You'll be taking a based decision if it's worth it to learn a new language 
or the prospects of the language you're currently working with.

Hr's look for profiles based on keywords
[look for example keywords]
You need to put the keywords on your title and in the other tabs as well, 
but the title is the more important.

You can perform SQL query operation on Linkeding search bar
[put examples here]

there are 5 tabs that Linkedin looks for information when it's going to 
consider if it should display you as a possible candidate for search:
it reads your profile from top to bottom.
title
about
experiences
projects
experiences
These are the tabs.

To appear in the first pages of the recruiter search we need 5 things:
mutue conections with the recruiter
linkedin activity - measured by linkeding tests, posts, iteractions and 
etc.
it's also important to receive recomendation about your skills by other 
users.

you need:
find the requirements with the biggest flow of search in your technology.
put these words in your tabs and in the correct form.
create strategic connections with people in your area
you can add personal experience in your projects tab.
you can also add job notifications in the queries that you perform.

your projects should be related to the orientation of the company you want 
to apply to, like fintech, communication platforms, automobile, streaming, 
e-commerce, you should commit yourself to projects that most of these 
companies would be interested.
also, you need to be able to expose your expertise in the interview, like 
the technologies that you worked and how you integrated them in your 
project.

you should also check your profile config to ensure that you aren't 
privating any of your content that could help you to
find a position.
you should set the language in your profile according to the positions that
your are aiming.

you need to have at least 1000 connections in your profile to help the 
recruiters to find your profile, the vast majority
should be recruiter.
search for "tech recruiter" to find connections.

you need to show your value to the interviwer, not only that, but in your 
linkeding and resume as well.
note that there's more opportunities to seniors not because of the 
experience time they have, but because they add
a lot more value than the others.

check the job opportunities and, inside the "requirements" topic, list all 
the requirements that the opportunity is
requiring, do that for some opportunities (e.g. 20) and you'll have a list 
of keywords that you need to have in your
resume and linkedin to appear in the search.

You can also search job opportunities in the post tab in linkedin py 
appending the word "vaga" at the beggining and the language or framework 
you want,
also you need to filter for the most recent ones.
You'll have a list of posts about job opportunities, this is a good way of 
searching because you won't receive 
fixed positions like in the job tab.
the number of comments in the post resembles the number of condidates.

Querying in Linkedin
1. putting something between "" searches for an exact match.
2. you can use logical operators like AND, OR, NOT, etc.
3. you can use LATAM as a filter to ensure that the opportunity is open for latin america.
4. using "Back" as a filter for "back end" and "back-end" works, but "backend" opportunities won't appear in the search.
5. enable notifications for the filters you make.
6. OR filters must be enclosed in ().
7. applying filters to posts apply a character limit to your search.
8. common names:
   - "Junior" OR "Jr" OR "Entry"
   - "Pleno" OR "Pl" OR "Mid"
   - "Senio" OR "SR" OR "SÃªnior"
   - "Oportunidade" OR "Vaga" OR "Hiring"
9. should filter posts for the most recent not posts from the last month.
10. OR filters should be the last ones in the querie.

using queries in the "jobs" tab will filter for text in the TITLE of the opportunity, it won't filter text in the job description.
so using texts like "hiring" or "LATAM" in the "jobs" tabs, won't be very effective.
If you want to search for text inside the description, you should apply the search in the "posts" tab, as it will search for the specified text in the body of the post.

You can also apply these active search queries on Google an search for opportunities that are also outside of Linkedin
you should filter for the indexes of the last month.

you can also use the query on google:
site:linkedin.com + query 
and filter for date of the indexing and it'll redirect you to the opportunity.

if you want to search opportunities that aren't in linkedin:
query + "- site:likedin.com"
this will apply the query and remove all results that lead to linkedin.com

if you're searching on Google, you can change "Latam" for "Remote" and the opportunities will probably have a higher
salary.

also is good to notice that most opportunities aren't in linkedin anymore as it has become very expensive to post
a job opportunity.
that's why using google is a good choice, also it helps in finding new platform directed for what you want,
for example turing, which is focused to help developers to work for US companies.

you can use chat gpt to filter the keywords of descriptions of opportunities that you would apply to, and with that
you would be able to add more relevant keywords to your profile and also have a solid understanding about what
you should study, or, what the market is requiring the most.
a good filter would be: "keywords related to programing languages and frameworks/libraries".
your should do this with 10 to 20 job descriptions.
