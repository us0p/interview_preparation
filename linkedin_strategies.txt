Picking a language:
If you use stackoverflow survey you can track the least popular languages
with the highest paying rate in the last year, and, if the language is
consistent over the survey in the past years, you can then search in 
Linkedin for the number of available roles for that language, with that you
can apply to roles that will pay you a good sum and won't have too much 
competition.
You'll be taking a based decision if it's worth it to learn a new language or
the prospects of the language you're currently working with.
