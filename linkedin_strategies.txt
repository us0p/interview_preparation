Picking a language:
If you use stackoverflow survey you can track the least popular languages
with the highest paying rate in the last year, and, if the language is
consistent over the survey in the past years, you can then search in 
Linkedin for the number of available roles for that language, with that you
can apply to roles that will pay you a good sum and won't have too much 
competition.
You'll be taking a based decision if it's worth it to learn a new language 
or the prospects of the language you're currently working with.

Hr's look for profiles based on keywords
[look for example keywords]
You need to put the keywords on your title and in the other tabs as well, 
but the title is the more important.

You can perform SQL query operation on Linkeding search bar
[put examples here]

there are 5 tabs that Linkedin looks for information when it's going to 
consider if it should display you as a possible candidate for search:
it reads your profile from top to bottom.
title
about
experiences
projects
experiences
These are the tabs.

To appear in the first pages of the recruiter search we need 5 things:
mutue conections with the recruiter
linkedin activity - measured by linkeding tests, posts, iteractions and 
etc.
it's also important to receive recomendation about your skills by other 
users.

you need:
find the requirements with the biggest flow of search in your technology.
put these words in your tabs and in the correct form.
create strategic connections with people in your area
you can add personal experience in your projects tab.
you can also add job notifications in the queries that you perform.

your projects should be related to the orientation of the company you want 
to apply to, like fintech, communication platforms, automobile, streaming, 
e-commerce, you should commit yourself to projects that most of these 
companies would be interested.
also, you need to be able to expose your expertise in the interview, like 
the technologies that you worked and how you integrated them in your 
project.

you should also check your profile config to ensure that you aren't 
privating any of your content that could help you to
find a position.
you should set the language in your profile according to the positions that
your are aiming.

you need to have at least 1000 connections in your profile to help the 
recruiters to find your profile, the vast majority
should be recruiter.
search for "tech recruiter" to find connections.

you need to show your value to the interviwer, not only that, but in your 
linkeding and resume as well.
note that there's more opportunities to seniors not because of the 
experience time they have, but because they add
a lot more value than the others.

check the job opportunities and, inside the "requirements" topic, list all 
the requirements that the opportunity is
requiring, do that for some opportunities (e.g. 20) and you'll have a list 
of keywords that you need to have in your
resume and linkedin to appear in the search.

You can also search job opportunities in the post tab in linkedin py 
appending the word "vaga" at the beggining and the language or framework 
you want,
also you need to filter for the most recent ones.
You'll have a list of posts about job opportunities, this is a good way of 
searching because you won't receive 
fixed positions like in the job tab.
the number of comments in the post resembles the number of condidates.
